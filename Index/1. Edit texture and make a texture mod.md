------------

 　　This first tutorial is a guide to making a simple eyeline mod.

　　Before starting, we will need a template for drawing the eyeline to help find the correct position on the head when we paint the eyeline later. To start with, open the abdata\chara folder and look at their filenames. You will see many files given prefixes and special case files such as:

> - ao_ - Accessory
> - bo_ - Head and Hair
> - mt_ - textures
> - oo_base - Main Body Texture
> - mm_base - Main Body Mesh
> - face_present_50 - Default Face Preset
> - etc - Null Reference

　　The first main step is to extract the eyeline UV map, which will serve as the template for painting our eyeline. To do this we will need the eyeline mesh from the head model. For an explanation on UVs see the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping

> 1. Open SB3UGS and open the file bo_head_00.unity3d
> 2. Double click p_cf_head_00 on the panel underneath
> 3. In the first middle column, select the Mesh tab
> 4. In this list, select cf_O_eyeline
> 5. In the column to the right of this list, click the Export button
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/SB3UGS_export_eyeline.gif)

　　The Script window at the right corner of SB3UGS  includes the export statement with the export folder. We will now be moving to blender to generate a UV image. The key setting to note here is when importing our mesh, we want to set our scale to 100x as the game meshes are very small.

![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/scale100.png)

　　Now we will prepare our UV layer for painting:

> 1. Select your imported model with a left click
> 2. Press 'Tab' to enter the model's edit mode and press '1' to enter Vertex Selection Mode, then press 'A' to select all of the vertices
> 3. Pull out a new window and change its type to UV Editor
> 4. Select the UV Menu dropdown and choose "Export UV Layout"
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/blenderUV.gif)

　　Now that we have our UV layout we can draw over top of this in any image editor software. We want to paint on a layer that resides on top of our exported UV Layout map rather than on the same layer. Once you have a new layer to paint on top of, you can now paint your eyeline.

![My final work](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/GIMPUV.png)

　　Once you have finished your new eyeline, you will want to hide the layer that the UV Layout resides on because we don't want it to show up in-game once we re-import it. Next, you will want to resize the entire image to a 512x512 size as this is the texture size accepted by Koikatsu. After completing both steps, you can then export your image to png. 
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/gimpscale.gif)

　　Once exported, you will want to resize your image down to 256x256, along with adding a '_low' suffix to your filename. i.e. if your filename is cw_t_eyeline_up_000, your low resolution filename will be cw_t_eyeline_up_000_low. The filename, in this case, is important, as the _low suffix file will be used during the free-roaming mode in single-player to reduce CPU/GPU utilization. If the name does not match or the suffix is missing, the eyeline won't show up on that character in free roam mode!

　　Now that we have our new eyeline textures exported, we want to bring them back into the game. This guide will be showing you how to bring the texture back in by replacing existing resources. Please see the Stage 2 guide (currently pending) for instructions on how to create a sideloader mod which does not require you to replace existing eyelines and instead adding a new entry to the eyelines list in the character maker.

　　To replace existing eyelines, we need to choose our target file. Back in SB3UGS, open the file 00.unity3d from the abdata\list\characustom folder. When looking at this list, you will notice that the animator list is similar to the resources you saw earlier under abdata\chara. Now you will select mt_eyeline_up_00 in the bottom left panel.
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/eyelineupSB3UGS.png)

　　Once selected you will be presented with a spreadsheet of data with the following columns:
> - ID - Used to uniquely identify the resource
> - Kind & Possess - Unknown, but they should all be identical
> - Name - The display name that will be used in-game
> - MainAB - The file path of the resource
> - EyelineUpTex - The name of the texture
> - EyelineShadowTex - Eyeline shadow texture
> - ThumbAB - The path of the thumbnail image
> - ThumbTex - The name of the thumbnail image

　　Since we are replacing an existing texture, we only need one target. In this example, we will choose "タイプ１", with the file path chara/mt_eyeline_up_00.unity3d.

> 1. Navigate back to the abdata\chara folder and use SB3UGS to open mt_eyeline_up_00.unity3d.
> 2. Open cw_t_eyeline_up_00 (not cw_t_eyeline_kage_000!)m this will open a Materials and Textures tab to the right
> 3. Drag in your new eyeline textures. This will open a new Images tab to the bottom left
> 4. Select cf_O_eyeline_1.png in the bottom left panel, and then press and hold "Shift" then select in the next panel to the right "cw_t_eyeline_up_000"
> 5. Click on the replace button on the right side of the Materials and Textures tab
> 6. Repeat for the _low version of your texture (replacing cw_t_eyeline_up_00_low with cf_O_eyeline_1_low)
> 7. Save your file, In 'file' window press 'File' > 'Save .unity3d'.Or use shortcut 'Ctrl+S'.Don't worry,SB3UGS will create a backup copy.

　　Now we can open the game to see the changes in the character maker.

### Use SB3UGS to extract UV

　　Now we know how to use Blender to extract UV layout, but there is a more convenient way is to use SB3UGS to do the extract job.See enimaroah's [Painting-Eye-Lashes-in-2d](https://github.com/enimaroah/SB3Utility/wiki/Painting-Eye-Lashes-in-2d "Painting-Eye-Lashes-in-2d") for more information.

### Use plugin([Material Editor](https://www.patreon.com/posts/30963568)) to quick view the eyeline effect

　　It's tedious if we use the current method to view the eyeline effect since we need to replace files and open game dozens of times. What if we could replace the eyeline when the game is running here I will explain how to use plugins to help us make mod.

　　First you need to install BepInEX([How to install](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/wiki/Installation)) and [Material Editor](https://www.patreon.com/posts/30963568).About how to install plugins,after you installed BepInEX,put .dll into \BepInEx which at the game's root folder.

　　Then to open body selection in Material Editor, the default setting about body selection was closed.

> 1. Open Plugin Setting menu (press F1 and click the button on the upper right corner)
> 2. Enable advanced editing of Material Editor (you may use the search bar to find it)
> 3. Restart the game
> 4. You should see there are 3 buttons in Maker -> Face -> All
> - (Quote from [How to open Face/Body Material Editor Menu](https://discordapp.com/channels/447114928785063977/447133555844448267/630863668673773580) by Rem27#9737(Discord))

　　Now click 'Open Material Editor(All),scroll down to find 'Material:cf_m_eyeline_00_up'. You will see the 'import file' button. Import the eyeline you've painted before will replace the current eyeline to yours. Be notice you it's not replaced the game resources. You still need to make a mod to replace or add your eyeline.

----------

### Make an independent hardmod

　　Our current workflow is to replace exist resources. What if we want to keep the main resource in the meantime add our new items? The method exists.'Create' your assetbundle and list file to make an independent mod and placed them in the game folder. We call the workflow like this is to make a hardmod.

　　Let's begin. Create an empty assetbundle, place your eyeline then save as a new one.

> 1. Open an "mt_" file, which means a texture assetbundle. At here I choose to open mt_ramp_00.unity3d
> 2. Select all contents, remove them by 'Assets'>'Attention!'>'Remove'.The last things left behind in this file is harmless, and you can't delete it any way.

　　SB3UGS can delete textures and materials, but it can't delete regular animators, so that's why we need to choose texture assetbundle, but not the other files. And these 2 steps called 'Make an empty assetbbundle'

> 3. Open Material Texture Editor by 'Assets'>'Material Texture Editor'
> 4. Drag your 2 eyeline images from outside to your SB3UGS
> 5. Switch to 'Texture' tab, click 'Add image'.Your eyeline should be added in.
> 6. Change the CAB-string. Go to 'File'>'CABinest(s)' and change CAB string.

　　Keep 'CAB-' but delete the other chars, then type in your random chars. Or you could just rename your CAB-string like 'CAB-mytest'.

　　CAB-string is something like ID. It was generated by Unity when Unity was packing assetbundle. The game identifies the file by CAB-string but not their filename. So if you forget to change CAB-string, your file will be conflict with the original one and the game won't load the both file.

> 7. Use 'Save .unity3d As...' to save your eyeline file.

　　Now you finished import your eyeline into an asset, but it's not enough. Without a 'list file' game won't know where and how and where to add your eyeline into itself.

> 1. Go to abdata\list\characustom and open 00.unity3d.
> 2. Open list "mt_eyeline_up_00"
> 3. Sign your eyeline into this list file

![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/eyeline%20entry3.png)
![](https://github.com/xm007/Koikatsu-Modding/blob/master/Image/1/eyeline%20entry2.png)

　　Here is an example of how to sign your eyeline. The ID must be unique so it won't conflict to the other item. Assign the same number with the other when dealing with Kind and Poses. We haven't made kage texture so far so leave the kage to 0(empty).

> 4. Delete unnecessary entries.

　　Select the entry by clicking the little arrow at the leftmost column. Then press 'DEL' to delete them.

> 5. Make an empty assetbundle and change the CAB string.
> 6. Copy your modified list by press 'Assets'>'Mark/Unmark for Copying' or 'Alt'+'M' to mark your copy and paste the list by press 'Assets'>'Paste All Marked' or 'Alt'+'P' to the new empty assetbundle.
> 7. Save the assetbundle under abdata\list\characustom

　　Now we finished both new asset and list files. Time to take a look at what happened in-game.
